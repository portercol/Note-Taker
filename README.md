## Description
Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. It will also be using different modules and different API routes generated through the backend.

## How it works
    1. The user is taken to a home page where they can 'get started' to create unique notes. 
    2. When arriving at the notes page they can click in the text boxes to input a 'note title' & 'note text'. 
    3. After saving the note they will see it saved on the left where they can either view the note or delete it if it's not needed.
